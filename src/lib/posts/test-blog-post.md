# Welcome to My Blog

This is the content of my first blog post. I can write **markdown** here and it will be converted to HTML.

## Code Example

```javascript
const greeting = 'Hello, World!';
console.log(greeting);
```

## Lists Work Too

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

That's all for now!

{
  "dependencies": {
    "gray-matter": "^4.0.3",
    "remark": "^14.0.2",
    "remark-html": "^15.0.1"
  }
}
